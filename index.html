      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Experience shaped by real systems, scale, and ownership</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      I am a Backend Engineering Manager with over a decade of experience
      building, scaling, and operating production systems across both
      consumer-facing and enterprise B2B platforms.
      My work has spanned high-traffic applications as well as
      correctness-critical systems used by large organizations.
    </p>

    <p>
      I specialize in backend architecture using Node.js,
      system and API design, data modeling, and reliability engineering.
      I have designed systems that evolve over time, handle real-world
      failure scenarios, and remain maintainable as teams and requirements grow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond hands-on technical work, I lead engineering teams and
      take ownership of delivery outcomes.
      I work closely with product, design, and business stakeholders to
      translate ambiguous requirements into clear technical direction,
      while maintaining a strong engineering culture focused on quality,
      predictability, and learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      I care deeply about building systems that teams can trust —
      systems that are observable, resilient, and designed with
      long-term sustainability in mind rather than short-term fixes.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>What I optimize for:</strong>
    I optimize for systems that are reliable before they are clever,
    teams that can deliver predictably rather than heroically,
    and architectures that can evolve without constant rewrites.
    In practice, this means prioritizing clear ownership, simple interfaces,
    operational visibility, and decisions that reduce long-term cost
    even when they require short-term discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
  <strong>What I deliberately avoid:</strong>
  I avoid unnecessary complexity, premature optimization,
  and architectures that are difficult to reason about or operate.
  I’m cautious of solutions that look elegant on paper but increase
  cognitive load for teams or hide operational risk.
  I also avoid relying on hero-driven execution, preferring systems
  and processes that allow teams to succeed sustainably.

    <div class="section-header">
      <h2>How I Think About System Design</h2>
      <p style="margin-top:24px; color:#475569;">
         I treat engagement systems, analytics, and communication pipelines
        as first-class backend concerns, especially in learning platforms
        where outcomes matter more than feature counts.
        These principles are reflected in the systems I’ve built across
        consumer platforms like NEO and enterprise products such as
        Thriversity and IPJ, where real-world constraints shaped
        architectural and operational decisions.
        </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      My approach to system design is shaped by building and operating
      real production systems across both consumer and enterprise environments.
      I focus less on theoretical perfection and more on designs that
      work reliably under real-world constraints.
    </p>

    <div class="grid" style="margin-top:32px">
        <div class="card">
    <h3>Designing for Engagement, Not Just Delivery</h3>
    <p>
      For learning platforms, system success is measured by learner completion,
      not just feature delivery. I design backend systems that actively support
      engagement through timely nudges, reminders, and behavioral signals.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Event-Driven Communication</h3>
    <p>
      I use event-based triggers to power email and notification workflows,
      enabling systems to react to learner behavior such as inactivity,
      progress milestones, or upcoming deadlines.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Observability Through Product Analytics</h3>
    <p>
      Beyond logs and metrics, I rely on product analytics to understand
      how users interact with systems. This feedback loop informs both
      technical decisions and product improvements.
    </p>
  </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Start with the Problem</h3>
        <p>
          I begin by understanding the business goal, expected usage patterns,
          and operational constraints. Scale, latency, and availability requirements
          guide architectural choices from the start.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Design for Change</h3>
        <p>
          Systems evolve. I prefer designs that allow iteration without large rewrites —
          clear API boundaries, modular services, and data models that can adapt
          as requirements change.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Reliability Over Cleverness</h3>
        <p>
          Simple, well-understood patterns are often more reliable than complex designs.
          I optimize for debuggability, predictable behavior, and operational clarity
          over unnecessary abstraction.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Plan for Failure</h3>
        <p>
          Failures are inevitable. I design systems assuming partial outages —
          with graceful degradation, clear error handling, and recovery strategies
          that reduce blast radius and mean time to recovery.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Data Integrity Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Especially in enterprise systems, correctness and consistency
          often matter more than raw throughput. I make deliberate trade-offs
          around consistency models and data ownership.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Operational Visibility</h3>
        <p>
          A system is only as good as its observability.
          I prioritize logging, metrics, and clear operational signals
          so teams can confidently operate and evolve the system.
