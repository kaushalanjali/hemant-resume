<!-- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY -->
<section class="section soft">

      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      NEO is a consumer-facing real estate platform built from scratch to
      surface pre-construction and under-construction property listings —
      inventory that is often missing or fragmented across traditional MLS systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I owned the backend architecture end-to-end, from initial system design
      through first production launch and subsequent growth. The platform was
      designed to support highly variable listing data, performance-sensitive
      search queries, and fluctuating consumer traffic while remaining simple
      to operate and evolve.
    </p>

    <p>
      This case study outlines the zero-to-one decisions, trade-offs, and
      production learnings involved in taking NEO from concept to a live,
      consumer-used system.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- PROBLEM -->
<section class="hero">
  <div class="container">
    <h3>Problem</h3>

    <p>
      When we started NEO, the real estate ecosystem lacked a dedicated,
      centralized marketplace for pre-construction and new-build inventory.
      Traditional MLS platforms did not consistently surface this data,
      limiting discovery for agents, developers, buyers, and investors.
    </p>

    <p>
      From a zero-to-one standpoint, the challenge was to design a backend
      system capable of supporting multiple stakeholder types, dynamic and
      non-uniform listing attributes, and performance-sensitive search —
      all without the safety net of an existing architecture.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- BUSINESS CONTEXT -->
<section class="section soft">
  <div class="container">
    <h3>Business & User Context</h3>

    <p>NEO serves multiple user groups with overlapping but distinct needs:</p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Developers</strong> publishing new and upcoming inventory</li>
      <li><strong>Real estate agents</strong> discovering and marketing new projects</li>
      <li><strong>Homebuyers</strong> browsing verified new communities</li>
      <li><strong>Investors</strong> identifying early-stage opportunities</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The backend needed to reconcile these perspectives into a single,
      searchable platform while supporting rapid data changes and
      evolving product requirements.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- ROLE -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <h3>My Role & Ownership</h3>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Designed backend architecture from scratch</li>
      <li>Owned API design and data modeling decisions</li>
      <li>Built scalable Node.js services</li>
      <li>Led first production launch and early iteration</li>
      <li>Worked closely with product to translate domain complexity into systems</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- ARCHITECTURE -->
<section class="section soft">
  <div class="container">
    <h3>System Design & Architecture</h3>

    <p>
      The backend followed a stateless service architecture to enable
      horizontal scalability and predictable performance under variable load.
    </p>

    <p>
      MongoDB was used to model property and project data with significant
      variability across regions, builders, and project types. Indexing and
      query optimization were applied to support fast search and filtering
      across large datasets.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- KEY DECISIONS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <h3>Key Decisions & Trade-offs</h3>

    <p>
      As a greenfield system, decisions balanced speed of delivery with
      long-term sustainability:
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        <strong>Flexible schemas over rigid modeling:</strong>
        Enabled rapid onboarding of diverse listings at the cost of
        stricter validation, mitigated through application-level checks.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>REST APIs over complex paradigms:</strong>
        Prioritized debuggability and predictable behavior for early growth.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Operational simplicity over premature optimization:</strong>
        Avoided over-engineering to ensure the system remained easy to
        operate and iterate with a small team.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- FIRST LAUNCH -->
<section class="section soft">
  <div class="container">
    <h3>First Production Launch</h3>

    <p>
      The initial launch focused on stability and observability rather
      than feature completeness.
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Launched with a minimal but robust feature set</li>
      <li>Monitored real traffic patterns and search behavior</li>
      <li>Used production feedback to guide schema and API evolution</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This approach allowed the system to evolve based on real usage
      instead of assumptions.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- WHAT I’D DO DIFFERENTLY -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <h3>What I’d Do Differently Today</h3>

    <p>
      With hindsight from production operation, I would:
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Introduce clearer domain boundaries earlier as usage grew</li>
      <li>Formalize observability and metrics sooner</li>
      <li>Plan explicit data evolution paths earlier in the lifecycle</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These refinements reflect learnings from scale rather than
      fundamental architectural mistakes.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- IMPACT -->
<section class="section soft">
  <div class="container">
    <h3>Impact</h3>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Enabled discovery of new-build inventory outside traditional MLS systems</li>
      <li>Provided a centralized platform for agents and developers</li>
      <li>Handled real-world consumer traffic reliably from launch</li>
      <li>Established a backend foundation capable of regional and data growth</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The system was designed to scale predictably while remaining
      simple to operate and evolve.
